# Chatbot


## Getting Started
---
You are going to want to go the first reference link of this readme and download Python 3.9.13. You may not need to do this, but for my configuration, it worked. After downloading Python 3.9.13, you are going to want to run these commands in the terminal
```{python}
pip install sugaroid-chatterbot
pip install sugaroid-chatterbot-corpus
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
pip install Mako==1.1.2
pip install SQLAlchemy==1.3.6
```
after this, you should be able to make a chatbot up to the specifications that you want!

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
chatbot.py                      (file where the chatbot will reside)
README.md                       (general information about project)
.gitignore                      (ignore file for any files that don't need to be pushed to GitHub)
```

## Required Technologies
---
* An IDE like VSCode
* Python 3.9.13
